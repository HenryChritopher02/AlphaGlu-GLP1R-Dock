# 🧬 AG-GLP1R-AlloDock

### Dual-Acting Modulators of α-Glucosidase & GLP-1 Receptor

This Streamlit application serves as an interactive dashboard for analyzing molecular docking simulations of dual-acting antidiabetic agents. It visualizes the allosteric binding interactions of ligands against two key Type II Diabetes targets: **Alpha-Glucosidase (AG)** and the **GLP-1 Receptor (GLP-1R)**.
